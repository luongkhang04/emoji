Emojis add emotional nuance and emphasis to online writing, yet manually selecting the right emoji can interrupt typing flow. This report studies \textbf{single-label emoji prediction from short social-media text} and presents an end-to-end pipeline: (i) building a cleaned tweet-style dataset of 835{,}428 English posts across 43 emoji classes, (ii) benchmarking classical and neural text classifiers, and (iii) deploying the best model for \textbf{client-side} inference in the browser. We compare TF--IDF baselines (linear SVM, logistic regression, and multinomial Naive Bayes), FastText-style subword models \cite{joulin2017bag}, TextCNN \cite{kim2014cnn}, bidirectional RNNs with attention, and a fine-tuned DistilBERT Transformer \cite{sanh2019distilbert}. On the held-out test split (83{,}543 samples), DistilBERT achieves the strongest ranking quality with \textbf{top-1 accuracy 26.3\%} and \textbf{top-5 accuracy 56.6\%}. For practical deployment, we export the fine-tuned Transformer to \textbf{quantized ONNX} and run it entirely in the browser using Transformers.js and an ONNX Runtime WebAssembly backend, enabling low-latency and privacy-preserving emoji suggestions without server-side inference \cite{onnx,transformersjs}. We additionally release an interactive web application at \url{https://luongkhang04.github.io/emoji/} and a Microsoft Edge extension at \url{https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/emoji-suggest/jdjoadakfkdcdllijajaepmplaodkkhj}.
